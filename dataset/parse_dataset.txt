Wilhelm Schickard 's 1623 device was the first of a number of mechanical calculators constructed by European engineers , but none fit the modern definition of a computer
they could not be programmed

In 1801 , Joseph Marie Jacquard made an improvement to the textile loom by introducing a series of punched paper cards as a template
a template which allowed his loom to weave intricate patterns automatically

The resulting Jacquard loom was an important step in the development of computers
the use of punched cards to define woven patterns can be viewed as an early , albeit limited , form of programmability

In 1837 , Charles Babbage was the first to conceptualize and design a fully programmable mechanical computer , his analytical engine

The analytical engine should not be confused with Babbage 's difference engine

the key features that are seen in modern computers
A succession of steadily more powerful and flexible computing devices were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s , gradually adding the key features

The use of digital electronics -LRB- largely invented by Claude Shannon in 1937 -RRB- and more flexible programmability were vitally important steps , but defining one point along this road as " the first digital electronic computer " is difficult

Notable achievements include : Konrad Zuse 's electromechanical " Z machines "

The U.S. Army 's Ballistics Research Laboratory ENIAC -LRB- 1946 -RRB- , electronic computer -LRB- since Konrad Zuse 's Z3 of 1941 used electromagnets instead of electronics -RRB-

Several developers of ENIAC , recognizing its flaws , came up with a far more flexible and elegant design
a far more flexible and elegant design which came to be known as the " stored program architecture " or von Neumann architecture

A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored - program architecture commenced around this time , the first of these being completed in Great Britain

Computers using vacuum tubes as their electronic elements were in use throughout the 1950s , but by the 1960s had been largely replaced by transistor - based machines , , required less power , and were more reliable
transistor - based machines which were smaller , faster , cheaper to produce

In the 1970s , integrated circuit technology and the subsequent creation of microprocessors , such as the Intel 4004 , further decreased size and cost and further increased speed and reliability of computers

By the late 1970s , many products such as video recorders contained dedicated computers called microcontrollers , and they started to appear as a replacement to mechanical controls in domestic appliances such as washing machines

The 1980s witnessed home computers and the now ubiquitous personal computer

Latin Francia which literally means " land of the Franks " or " Frankland "

The borders of modern France are approximately the same as those of ancient Gaul
ancient Gaul which was inhabited by Celtic Gauls

the French language evolved
Gaul was conquered for Rome by Julius Caesar in the 1st century BC , and the Gauls eventually adopted Roman speech -LRB- Latin , -RRB- and Roman culture

Gaul was the only region
St. Jerome wrote
Christianity first appeared in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD , and became so firmly established by the fourth and fifth centuries “ free from heresy ”

In the 4th century AD , Gaul ’s eastern frontier along the Rhine was overrun by Germanic tribes , principally the Franks , from
the ancient name of “ Francie ” was derived

The modern name “ France ” derives from the name of the feudal domain of the Capetian Kings of France around Paris

Existence as a separate entity began with the Treaty of Verdun -LRB- 843 -RRB- , with the division of Charlemagne 's Carolingian Empire into East Francia , Middle Francia and Western Francia

The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987
Hugh Capet , Duke of France and Count of Paris , was crowned King of France

His descendants , the Direct Capetians , the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon , progressively unified the country through a series of wars and dynastic inheritance

The monarchy was the most powerful during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV of France

French became , and remained until the 20th century , the common language of diplomacy in international affairs

Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles , and major scientific breakthroughs were achieved by French scientists in the 18th century

In addition , France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas , Africa and Asia

The monarchy ruled France until the French Revolution , in 1789
